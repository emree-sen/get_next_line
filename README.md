# get_next_line
get_next_line is a project from the curriculum at 42 School that aims to recreate the behavior of the readline function in C. It reads a line from a file descriptor (FD) and returns it to the caller function. The project is designed to provide a deeper understanding of static variables, memory management, and file operations.
